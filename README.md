# Untitled Docker Web app... Thing
Currently, it is a toy web app that can spin multiple instances of both the API and front end using docker-compose.

## What it uses?
- Angular 18 for the front end
- Docker for the containers
- FastApi for the back end (Python3)

## How to run it?
Currently, the 'docker' component of the project has been paused until more progress is made on the app itself.

If you source .env you can access aliases to run the front and back end on localhost. There are also some other useful aliases in the file.
